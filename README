This game is a simple game inspired by "Gorillas" distributed with MS-DOS.
The first game of the series (HE Training Grounds) was written in Visual Basic 6, just by using Windows forms. I decided to recreate my game using openGL, as it seemed a good starting point to actually learn openGL.

This game is licenced under GNU General Public Licence version 3 or later.


--> 0.1 : 1.00-alpha1 codename Turtle

initial version, very simple collision detection, no explosions, only way to
win is to hit the enemy directly.

--> 0.2 : 1.00-alpha2 codename Firebug

added an explosion effect using a simple particle engine.

--> 0.3 : 1.00-alpha3 codename Tzitziki

added an explosion sound using openAL.

--> 0.4 : 1.00-alpha4 codename Cross

deleted openAL code as it was not clean (and also failed on Microsoft Windows)
cross-compiled for Microsoft Windows

--> 0.41 : 1.00-alpha4-1

changed the particle engine a bit

--> 0.45 : 1.00-alpha5 codename Re-F*ck-Tor

performed major refactoring on the game engine and classes
fitted a new display engine to all the animations
fitted a new particle engine
added rain

--> 0.5 : 1.00-beta1 codename You can reach the stars:

1st public release!
HE2 has been fully ported to Starlia, no overrides. This means that Starlia
must be installed before compiling.
HE2 now uses the widget scheme of Starlia, which is more powerful than nothing.
Since Starlia is for now toy game engine (not even alpha yet), and since many 
API/ABI breaks are bound to happen, see HE2 as the best benchmark for Starlia,
and not something that is going to be the way it is now :)

added main menu
added labels, rendering command line prints useless
added in-game menu
now cannon fires at the point clicked, not at the last pointed position

various bugfixes and polishes



TODO:
--- This section exists as a reminder to myself, and not as a list of definite future features, so expect it to be a little illegible ---

--> someday (but before 1.00 final is released):
+ polish the particle engine, maybe add it to Starlia
- HE1 options - Blood (particles), Ground indentation, Wind (Global Variable?)
- people dismemberment
- kill by hitting ground beside
- more realistic explosions depending on velocity

--> someday (probably after 1.00 is released, but not sure)
- reintroduce openAL, add explosion and thunder sound, add voice of people saying bad words :)
- make the particle engine even more generic (handle sandstorm)
- look if the transition between levels can be more smooth (and not more Kaprekar :P)
- create a more cross-platform and clean code for online multiplaying (boost::asio?) by following version 0xCAFEBABE
