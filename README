This game is a simple game inspired by "Gorillas" distributed with MS-DOS.
The first game of the series (HE Training Grounds) was written in Visual Basic 6, just by using Windows forms. I decided to recreate my game using openGL, as it seemed a good starting point to actually learn openGL.

This game is licenced under GNU General Public Licence version 3 or later.


--> 0.1 : 1.00-alpha1 codename Turtle

initial version, very simple collision detection, no explosions, only way to
win is to hit the enemy directly.

--> 0.2 : 1.00-alpha2 codename Firebug

added an explosion effect using a simple particle engine.

--> 0.3 : 1.00-alpha3 codename Tzitziki

added an explosion sound using openAL.

--> 0.4 : 1.00-alpha4 codename Cross

deleted openAL code as it was not clean (and also failed on Microsoft Windows)
cross-compiled for Microsoft Windows

--> 0.41 : 1.00-alpha4-1

changed the particle engine a bit

--> 0.45 : 1.00-alpha5 codename Re-F*ck-Tor

performed major refactoring on the game engine and classes
fitted a new display engine to all the animations
fitted a new particle engine
added rain


TODO:
--- This sections exists as a reminder to myself, and not as a list of definite future features, so expect it to be a little illegible ---

--> next release: (0.5 aka 1.00-beta1)
+ move collision detection to dud (mandatory!)
+ should point laser when clicking (easy :) )
+ port HE2 to Starlia
-+ main menu
-+ render the score/angle/velocity inline in the window, but not with a label
+ 1st public release!
- more realistic explosions depending on velocity

--> someday (but before 1.00 final is released):
+ polish the particle engine
+ better collision detection, using a two point linear interpolation scheme, handled by D_engine (or Ph_engine :P)
- HE1 options - Blood (particles), Ground indentation, Wind (Global Variable?)
- people dismemberment
- kill by hitting ground beside

--> someday (probably after 1.00 is released, but not sure)
- reintroduce openAL, add explosion and thunder sound, add voice of people saying bad words :)
- make the particle engine even more generic (handle sandstorm)
- look if the transition between levels can be more smooth (and not more Kaprekar :P)
- create a more cross-platform and clean code for online multiplaying (boost::asio?) by following version 0xCAFEBABE
